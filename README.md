# cesm1to2
Project for investigating model bias changes from CESM1 to CESM2. Will end up with a fair bit of generalizable code for looking at GCM model output, specificially that from CESM.

project added to github on 2017-10-30

Code here is built around processing and plotting functions found in mdwtools (https://github.com/mdwoelfle/mdwtools.git).
